# Vector Space Semantics for a Character's Lines in Eastenders Script Data

This project aims to create a vector space semantics model for a document containing lines spoken by a character in the Eastenders script data. The vector space model represents words or phrases as vectors in a high-dimensional space, where the proximity of vectors reflects the semantic similarity of the corresponding words or phrases.

## Dataset:
The dataset used in this project consists of the Eastenders script data which contains the lines spoken by characters in the show. The dataset is not publicly available due to copyright issues.

## Methodology:
The methodology used in this project consists of the following steps:

1. Data cleaning and preprocessing: The lines spoken by the character are cleaned and preprocessed to remove stop words, punctuation, and other irrelevant information.

2. Vector representation: Each line spoken by the character is represented as a vector in a high-dimensional space using techniques such as word embeddings or term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF).

3. Similarity measurement: The cosine similarity between pairs of vectors is used as a measure of similarity between the corresponding lines spoken by the character.

## Conclusion:
Modeled a vector representation of a document that consisted of over 15,000 lines of dialogue spoken by characters in the 'Eastenders' show script data with 87.5% classification accuracy for identifying the character.
